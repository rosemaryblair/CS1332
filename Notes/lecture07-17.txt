Fibonacci - post-order traversal

Dynamic Programming:
- Method of problem solving by breaking down complex problems into smaller sub-problems.
- Two parts:
	1. Optimal substructure; DP is usually applied to optimization problems (requiring some min/max value).
	2. Overlapping sub-problems; sub-problems are revisited repeatedly when solving the problem.
